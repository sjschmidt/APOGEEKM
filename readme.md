# APOGEE KM
This repository is for the public version of the APOGEE KM dwarf catalog. The catalog is assocated with [this paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160503732S). For light analysis/plots, I suggest trying [the filtergraph portal)[https://filtergraph.com/apogee_km_dwarf_colors]. 

[APOGEE_KMdwarfs.fits](APOGEE_KMdwarf.fits): This is a catalog of 3834 late-K and early-M dwarfs (3500K < Teff < 4200K) that have relatively accurate metallicities and Teffs assigned from the SDSS APOGEE ASPCAP pipeline (discussed in [this paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1510.07635). It is cross-matched with SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE photometry, all of which have been corrected for extinction. Please look at the associated [README file](APOGEE_KMdwarf.README.txt) for definitions of each column, and see the [associated paper](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160503732S) for additional discussion. Generally, measurements are included whether they were considered "good" or "bad," so please pay attention to the various flags included.
